## Overview

**Build Concept:**    
This build focuses on the interaction between Budding, Vat-Grown, and Pleasure Seekers to grow pops rapidly on the Empire's Capital Planet. Combined with Civil Education in the late game, these millions of pops (serving as civilians) can output overwhelming research to greatly boost the power of your fleets.

**Strengths:**
- Example strength 1  
- Example strength 2  
- Example strength 3  

**Weaknesses:**
- Fanatic Pacifist  
- Example weakness 2

## WARNING!!!

Pops will grow quadratically after ascension. If Growth Required Scaling is turned off in the galaxy settings, this can lead to pop growth that not only comprimises the stability of your food economy but also the game itself with severe computational lag and integer overflow errors.

Notably, say your empire currently has $5,000,000$ pops. With Growth Required Scaling off and within about a year, you will double to $10,000,000$ pops. Within about two years, you will have over $1,000,000,000$ pops. In about three years, your pops would otherwise exceed $10^{1024}$ if the game had not given up at this point.
